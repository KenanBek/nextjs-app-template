# Generic Components

Generic components are components that are not specific to a particular project. They are designed to be used in a variety of projects.

Primary difference between generic and project specific components is that **generic components do not use data from project's configuration (title, description, etc).**

Generic components must be standalone and not use any project or other generic components.
