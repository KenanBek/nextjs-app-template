# Project Components

Project components are components that are specific to a particular project. They are designed to be used in a variety of projects.

Primary difference between generic and project specific components is that **project specific components use data from project's configuration (title, description, links, etc).**

Additionally, project components can use [generic components](../generic/README.md) as well. Whereas generic components must not use project or other generic components.
