# Next.js App Template

Next.js app template and boilerplate for SaaS, portfolio, landing page, and marketing websites.

## Components

Components are the building blocks of Next.js App Template. They are designed to be used in a variety of projects. All components are split into **generic** and **project** components.

- [Generic](./components/generic/README.md): independent components that can be used in any project and in other project components.
- [Project](./components/project/README.md): components that use data from [project's configuration](./config/README.md).

### List of Components

#### Generic

- `InfoBox`: box with centered text information.
- `PageHeader`: title and subtitle for a page.
- `CTAButton`: call-to-action button.
- `ThemeToggle`: theme toggle button.
- `CodeBlock`: code block with copy button.
- `FloatingNav`: floating navigation.
- `TableOfContents`: table of contents.
- `ScrollIndicator`: progress bar showing scroll position.

#### Project

- `Footer`: footer area with links and social media.
